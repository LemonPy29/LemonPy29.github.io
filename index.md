# Home
 
This site it's just another data scientist student blog. Here I share the things I've learned and I'll learn about machine and deep learning, probabilistic models and statistics in general. My main focus is understand the math behind and then transition that knowledge into code. Feel free to look at the sections in the left panel. I hope you have some fun and useful time reading the content.

# About me
My name is Alexis Moraga, ex math teacher and currently more interested in code and simulations. Find more about me in the links on the left.
