If you're inside the machine learning world, it's for sure you have  heard about gradient boosting algorithms such as *xgboost* [^1] or *lightgbm* [^2] .  Indeed, gradient boosting techniques have seen a lot of success in a variety of inference and predictions tasks, particularly  We'll try to answer this  question specifically for the case of gradient boosting for trees which  is the most popular case up today
