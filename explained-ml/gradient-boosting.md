### What is gradient boosting?

If you're inside the world of machine learning, it's for sure you have heard about gradient boosting algorithms such as xgboost or lightgbm. Indeed, 
gradient boosting represents the state-of-start for a lot of machine learning task, but how does it work? We'll try to answer this question specifically 
for the case of gradient boosting for trees which is the most popular case up today.
