Pyro Adventures is a section where I try to understand and apply the concepts of the book *Adventures in stochastic Processes [Sidney Resnick, 1992]* . The main idea is to take some examples of each chapter and take the theory into code with the help of Pyro. Pyro it's an API sitting on top of Pytorch for probabilistic programming, and includes lots of helpful methods and classes to model most of stochastic situations.
