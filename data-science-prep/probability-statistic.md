### Conditional Expectation [Robinhood]
*Statment*: Say X and Y are independent and uniformly distributed on (0, 1). What is the expected value of X, given that X > Y?

Using the definition of conditional expectation:

\\[
\textbf{E}(X|X>Y) = \dfrac{1}{\textbf{P}(X>Y)}\int_{ \{X>Y\} }Xd\textbf{P} \{a\}
\\]
