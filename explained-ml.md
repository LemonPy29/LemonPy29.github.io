Stay tune with every new machine learning algorithm/technique can often times be hard. And it's even harder to really understand what's behind those algorithms, specially if many papers just present some intuition of why this or that should work and boost the score. I'm not asking for mathematical proofs of everything, but going almost blind isn't healthy either.

On this section I try to get a better understanding of some of those modern techniques, and some older ones too. The aim is to compromise the math, the intuition/motivation and the code.
